# Grunt API Documentation

This repository is used for the [Grunt API](https://gruntapi.com) project documentation. You don't need to inconvenience yourself with parsing the Markdown and YAML files here, and instead can use the [documentation site](https://docs.gruntapi.com). However, do use this repository if you want to contribute to the content!
