# Grunt API Documentation

Grunt is an API for the Halo series of games. It is [open-source](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/grunt) and written in .NET as a starting point, but with goals to extend to Node.js and Python in the future.

Grunt is not doing anything other than wrap the official but undocumented Halo APIs in an easy-to-consume package. Because the APIs that are documented here are extracted by monitoring the game (you can read more in the [OpenSpartan Wiki](https://wiki.openspartan.com)), chances are that they will break at some point, so not everything might be working 100% of the time. You can expect a reasonable effort to try and investigate every such issue - my goal is to make sure that the libraries are working for those that use them.

## Getting Started

To get started, refer to the [introduction guide](articles/intro.md).

## Feedback

If you would like to report any issues or have feature suggestions or comments, make sure to file those [on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/grunt/issues).

## Contributions

Any contributions, either to this documentation or the library, are always welcome. Make sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/grunt/issues) ahead of time, though, so that we can discuss what needs to be done.
