# Grunt API .NET SDK

Grunt is a Halo API wrapper, originally written for .NET (but being extended beyond that) for the Halo Infinite web API. It's the unofficial way to talk to Halo services to get various data about in-game assets and player performance. You can look at the library source [on GitHub](https://github.com/dend/grunt).
