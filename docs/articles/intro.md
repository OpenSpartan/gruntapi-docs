# Getting Started with Grunt API

## .NET

To get started with Grunt, you will need to install the `Grunt` NuGet package. There are two sources of packages that you can use:

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/grunt/packages/). This is the package that is most frequently updated, but that may come at the cost of stability, as experimental changes are baked in with every commit and _things may break_.
2. [NuGet](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/grunt). This way, you're getting the most stable version, but you won't have updates as quickly for new or updated APIs, as releases on NuGet must undergo additional checks.
